- [x] Create API route: `GET /api/auctions/[id]` - Get auction details
- [x] Create API route: `POST /api/auctions/[id]/bid` - Place a bid
- [x] Implement bid validation logic (must be higher than current highest bid)
- [x] Create API route: `GET /api/users/[id]/auctions` - Get user's auction listings
- [x] Implement auction status update mechanism (background job or on-access check)

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & Seller Interface

### 2.1 User Registration & Login System

- [x] Create registration API route: `POST /api/auth/register`
- [x] Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Create login page UI (`/login`)
- [x] Create registration page UI (`/register`)
- [x] Add session management and protected route middleware
- [x] Implement logout functionality

### 2.2 Item Listing Creation Interface
- [x] Create "Create Auction" page UI (`/auctions/create`)
- [x] Implement form with fields:
  - Title
  - Description (textarea)
  - Starting price (number input)
  - Auction end date/time (datetime-local input)
  - Image URL (text input for MVP)
- [x] Add form validation (client-side and server-side)
- [x] Connect form submission to `POST /api/auctions` endpoint
- [x] Add success/error feedback messages
- [x] Implement redirect to auction detail page after successful creation

### 2.3 Seller Dashboard - View Own Listings
- [x] Create seller dashboard page (`/dashboard/auctions`)
- [x] Display list of user's auction listings
- [x] Show auction status, current highest bid, and time remaining
- [x] Add "Create New Auction" button linking to creation form
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile devices

---

## Phase 3: Buyer Interface & Bidding System

### 3.1 Browse/View Auctions Interface
- [x] Create main auctions listing page (`/auctions`)
- [x] Display all active auctions in a grid/list layout
- [x] Show key information for each auction:
  - Title
  - Current highest bid (or starting price if no bids)
  - Time remaining (countdown timer)
  - Thumbnail image (if available)
- [x] Implement auction detail page (`/auctions/[id]`)
- [x] Display full auction information on detail page
- [x] Add real-time countdown timer using client-side JavaScript

### 3.2 Bidding Interface & Backend Integration
- [x] Add bid input form to auction detail page
- [x] Implement client-side bid validation
- [x] Connect bid form to `POST /api/auctions/[id]/bid` endpoint
- [x] Display immediate feedback for successful/failed bids
- [x] Add bid history section showing recent bids
- [x] Implement automatic page refresh or polling for bid updates
- [x] Add protection against users bidding on their own auctions
